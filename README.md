The Maze project split into 3 parts.



Part A



Generate a "legal" maze using DFS algorithms which include entry and exit with a given size by the user.

Moudle the maze to a search problem and implement the solution of the maze as 3 different search algorithms:

 - BreadthFirstSearch

 - DepthFirstSearch

 - BestFirstSearch

 

Part B



Using client-server architecture to allow multiple clients to operate in parallel (using threads).

Send requests and receive responses from the servers using Strategy DP that creates mazes and solves mazes.

Using 2 different compression methods while sending mazes between client - server.



Part C



Using javaFX to create a GUI.

The design based Corona Vairus theme.

Using MVVM architecturaL pattren to implement the functionality between the Mode - View Model -Model layer where 

Each layer handles its own responsibility and uses Obesserver DP.

Adding sound to the game.

Adding Timer and saving the fastest player, display the top ranked players on the open screen.





Enter screen - insert name and then on the left side there is a record table which saves between games the record, sorted by the size and the time of solving the maze.

Generate a new maze by inserting the wanted size, and click generate. After click, generate the timer to start run.

While trying to solve the maze, you have the option to ask for the solution to the maze and the option to get back to the starting point.

When the maze is solved, a finished message appears and the rank table is updated if necessary
