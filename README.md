# Maze Project - PartC
Maze project - Part C
This game was created as a project in the course 'Advanced Topics in Programming', taken in 'Ben Gurion University' of Israel, as part of the 'Software and Information Systems Engineering' program.
Created on our second year of studying on 2021.
The Creators: Adi Marom and Ohad Miller.
Algorithms used in the game:
  - BreadthFirstSearch
  - DepthFirstSearch
  - BestFirstSearch


The Maze porject splited to 3 parts.

Part A

Genrate a "legal" maze using DFS algorithms which include entry and exit with a given size by the user.
Moudle the maze to a search problem and implent the soltuion of the maze as 3 diffrent search algorithms:
 - BreadthFirstSearch
 - DepthFirstSearch
 - BestFirstSearch
 
Part B

Using client-server architecture to allow multiple clients to operate in parallel (using threads).
Send requests and receive responses from the servers using Strategy DP that create mazes and solve mazes.
Using 2 diffrent compresse method while sending mazes between client - server.

Part C

Using javaFX to create a GUI. Desgin based Corona Vairus theme.
using MVVM architecturaL pattren to implent the functionlty betwen the Mode - View Model -Model layer where 
each layer handaling its own responsilty and using Obesserver DP.
Adding sound to the game.
Adding Timer and save the fastest player, display the top rank players on the open screen.


Enter screen - insert name and on the left side there are record table which save between game the record sorted by the size and the time of solving the maze.

Generate a new maze by inserting the wanted size, and click generate. After click generate the timer start run.

while tring solving the maze you have option to ask for the solution of the maze and option to get back to the starting point.

When the maze is solved, a finish message appear and the rank table is updating if neccery
